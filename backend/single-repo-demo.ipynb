It doesn\\\\'t yet handle all the various \\\"profiles\\\" that pyLODE 2.13.2 does, such as SKOS \\\\'vocabularies\\\\' & Profiles Vocabulary \\\\'profiles\\\\', it only handles OWL \\\\'ontologies\\\\', nor all the special data types, such as JSON literals, BUT, it generates HTML in a much more straightforward manner and the code is both more efficient and much more maintainable, which is why it\\\\'s been made.\\\\n\\\\nv 3.x will eventually catch up to all of v 2.13.2\\\\'s features.\\\\n\\\\nTo access v 2.13.2 of pyLODE, either `download it from PyPI <https://pypi.org/project/pyLODE/2.13.2/>`_ , `check it out from GitHub <https://github.com/RDFLib/pyLODE/releases/tag/2.13.2>`_ or access it via the `online service <http://pylode.surroundaustralia.com/>`_ .\\\\n\\\\n----\\\\n\\\\nContents\\\\n========\\\\n1. `Quick Intro`_\\\\n2.

Collaboration_\\\\n12. Contacts_\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nQuick Intro\\\\n===========\\\\nThe Live OWL Documentation Environment tool\\\\n(`LODE <https://github.com/essepuntato/LODE>`__) is a well-known (in\\\\nSemantic Web circles) Java & XSLT-based tool used to generate\\\\nhuman-readable HTML documents for OWL and RDF ontologies. That tool is\\\\nnow a bit dated (old-style HTML, use of older technologies like XSLT)\\\\nand its (`online version <https://www.essepuntato.it/lode>`__) is not always\\\\nonline.\\\\n\\\\nThis tool is a complete re-implementation of LODE\\\\'s functionality using\\\\nPython and Python\\\\'s RDF manipulation module,\\\\n`rdflib <https://pypi.org/project/rdflib/>`__. An ontology to be\\\\ndocumented is parsed and inspected using rdflib and HTML is generated\\\\ndirectly, using Python\\\\'s `dominate <https://pypi.org/project/dominate/>`__\\\\npackage.\\\\n\\\\nUse\\\\n===\\\\n\\\\nThe tool can be used in multiple ways:\\\\n\\\\n- BASH command line script\\\\n    - pyLODE.sh in bin/\\\\n- Windows EXE\\\\n    - pyLODE.exe in bin/\\\\n- Mac executable\\\\n    - pyLODE in bin/\\\\n- Python Script\\\\n    - cli.py or module\\\\n- as-a-service locally\\\\n    - via the popular `Falcon framework <https://falconframework.org/>`__.\\\\n    - see server.py in the main folder\\\\n- as-a-service online\\\\n    - hosted at https://pylode.surroundaustralia.com\\\\n\\\\nCommand line arguments\\\\n----------------------\\\\n\\\\nThe BASH, Windows EXE and Python Script methods all use the same command line\\\\narguments:\\\\n\\\\n::\\\\n\\\\n    usage: cli.py [-h] [-v] [-o OUTPUTFILE] [-c {true,false}] input\\\\n\\\\n    positional arguments:\\\\n        input                 Input file location or URL\\\\n\\\\n    optional arguments:\\\\n        -h, --help          show this help message and exit\\\\n        -v, --version       show program\\\\'s version number and exit\\\\n        -o OUTPUTFILE,\\\\n        --outputfile OUTPUTFILE\\\\n                            A name you wish to assign to the output file. Will be\\\\n                            postfixed with .html if not already added. If no\\\\n                            output file is given, output will be printed to screen\\\\n        -c {true,false},\\\\n        --css {true,false}\\\\n                            Whether (true) or not (false) to include CSS within an\\\\n                            output HTML file.\\\\n\\\\nBasic Use\\\\n^^^^^^^^^\\\\n\\\\n* as a Python script\\\\n* executed in this directory\\\\n\\\\n::\\\\n\\\\n    python pylode examples/minimal.ttl -o minimal.html\\\\n\\\\nThis will produce the file ``minimal.html`` in this directory which should\\\\nmatch exactly the file ``examples/minimal.html``.\\\\n\\\\n* as a docker container\\\\n\\\\nbuild the docker image\\\\n::\\\\n   docker build -t pylode:latest .\\\\n\\\\ncopy the example directory, mount it to the countainer and run cli.py in the container\\\\n::\\\\n   docker  run  --mount \\\\'type=bind,src=<ttl_directory>,target=/app/pylode/data\\\\' pylode:latest  python3.10 pylode/cli.py data/<ttl_file> -o data/<html_file>\\\\n\\\\n   Note: <ttl_directory> must be absolute \\\\n\\\\nModule Use\\\\n^^^^^^^^^^\\\\n\\\\n::\\\\n\\\\n    from pylode import OntDoc\\\\n\\\\n    # initialise\\\\n    od = OntDoc(ontology=\\\"some-ontology-file.ttl\\\")\\\\n\\\\n    # produce HTML\\\\n    html = od.make_html()\\\\n\\\\n    # or save HTML to a file\\\\n    od.make_html(destination=\\\"some-resulting-html-file.html\\\")\\\\n\\\\nThis will read from ``some-ontology-file.ttl`` to produce the file ``some-resulting-html-file.html`` in this directory.\\\\n\\\\nExamples\\\\n========\\\\n\\\\nThe `examples/ directory <https://github.com/RDFLib/pyLODE/tree/master/examples>`_\\\\ncontains multiple pairs of RDF & HTML files generated from them using this\\\\nversion of pyLODE.\\\\n\\\\nYou can also see rendered versions of these example files online too:\\\\n\\\\n* `minimal.html <https://rdflib.dev/pyLODE/examples/ontdoc/minimal.html>`_\\\\n* `agift.html <https://rdflib.dev/pyLODE/examples/ontdoc/agrif.html>`_\\\\n* `alternates.html <https://rdflib.dev/pyLODE/examples/ontdoc/alternates.html>`_\\\\n* `asgs.html <https://rdflib.dev/pyLODE/examples/ontdoc/asgs.html>`_\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nWhat pyLODE understands\\\\n=======================\\\\n\\\\npyLODE knows about definitional ontologies (``owl:Ontology``) and the major\\\\nelements usually found in them, such as classes (``owl:Class`` or ``rdf:Class)\\\\nand properties (``rdf:Property`` & ``owl:ObjectProperty`` etc.).\\\\n\\\\nTo see what properties for ontology, class and RDF property documentation\\\\npyLODE currently supports, just look in the ``rdf_elements.py`` file. All\\\\nelements\\\\' properties supported are given in property lists there.\\\\n\\\\npyLODES won\\\\'t just translate everything that you can describe in RDF into\\\\nHTML! This is a conscious design choice to ensure that a certain conventional\\\\nstyle of documented ontology is produced. However, support for new\\\\nproperties and ontology patterns can be made - just create an Issue on\\\\n`this project\\\\'s Issue tracker <https://github.com/RDFLib/pyLODE/issues>`__.\\\\n\\\\nWhile it *does* know about instance data, such as Named Individuals, it\\\\'s\\\\nnot really designed to document large ontologies containing class instances.\\\\n\\\\nNotes on Agents\\\\n---------------\\\\npyLODE can understand both simple and complex Agent objects. You can use\\\\nsimple string properties like ``dc:contributor \\\"Nicholas J. Car\\\"`` too if\\\\nyou really must but better would be to take advantage of real Linked Data\\\\nrepresentation, e.g. complex Agent objects with web addresses, emails,\\\\naffiliations, ORCIDs and so on, e.g.:\\\\n\\\\n::\\\\n\\\\n    <ontology_x>\\\\n        dct:creator [\\\\n            sdo:name \\\"Nicholas J. Car\\\" ;\\\\n            sdo:identifier <http://orcid.org/0000-0002-8742-7730> ;\\\\n            sdo:affiliation [\\\\n                sdo:name \\\"SURROUND Australia Pty Ldt.\\\" ;\\\\n                sdo:url \\\"https://surroundaustralia.com\\\"^^xsd:anyURI ;\\\\n            ] ;\\\\n        ] ;\\\\n\\\\nSee all the properties in ``rdf_elements.py:AGENT_PROPS`` for a list of\\\\nall the Agent properties pyLODE can handle.\\\\n\\\\nInstallation\\\\n============\\\\n\\\\npyLODE is `on PyPI <https://pypi.org/project/pyLODE/>`_, so you can install\\\\nit using `pip <https://pypi.org/project/pip/>`_ as normal:\\\\n\\\\n::\\\\n\\\\n    pip install pylode\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nTesting\\\\n=======\\\\n\\\\nIt\\\\'s best to disable warnings to hide pointless warnings from the RDFLib library.\\\\n\\\\n::\\\\n    ~$ python -m pytest tests --disable-warnings\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nDifferences from LODE\\\\n=====================\\\\n-  command line access\\\\n\\\\n   -  you can use this on your own desktop so you don\\\\'t need me to\\\\n      maintain a live service for use\\\\n\\\\n-  use of modern simple HTML\\\\n\\\\n   - no JavaScript: pyLODE generates static HTML pages\\\\n\\\\n-  catering for a wider range of ontology options such as:\\\\n\\\\n   -  schema.org ``domainIncludes`` & ``rangeIncludes`` for properties\\\\n\\\\n-  better Agent representation\\\\n\\\\n   - see the `Notes on Agents`_ section above\\\\n\\\\n-  smarter CURIES\\\\n\\\\n   -  pyLODE caches and looks up well-known prefixes to make more/better\\\\n      CURIES\\\\n   -  it tries to be smart with CURIE presentation by CURIE-ising all\\\\n      URIs it finds, rather than printing them\\\\n\\\\n-  reference ontologies property labels\\\\n\\\\n   - pyLODE caches ~ 10 well-known ontologies (RDFS, SKOS etc), properties from which people often use for their ontology documentation. Where these properties are used, the background ontology\\\\'s labels are use\\\\n\\\\n-  **active development**\\\\n\\\\n   -  pyLODE has been under active development since mid-2019 and is\\\\n      still very much actively developed - it\\\\'s not just staying still\\\\n   -  it will be improved in foreseeable to cater for more and more things\\\\n   -  recent ontology documentation initiatives such as the `MOD\\\\n      Ontology <https://github.com/sifrproject/MOD-Ontology>`__ will be\\\\n      handled, if requested\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nReleases\\\\n========\\\\npyLODE is under continual and constant development.
