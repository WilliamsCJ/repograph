The starting point for contributions should usually be [a discussion](https://github.com/encode/starlette/discussions)

Simple documentation typos may be raised as stand-alone pull requests, but otherwise please ensure you've discussed your proposal prior to issuing a pull request.

This will help us direct work appropriately, and ensure that any suggested changes have been okayed by the maintainers.
