2.2.4 - 2014-10-09
------------------

- Fix bugs triggered by turning multiprocessing on by default (again)

  Multiprocessing is forcibly disabled in the following cases:

  - Passing something in via stdin

  - Analyzing a diff

  - Using windows

- Fix --install-hook when there are no config files present for pep8 or
  flake8.

- Fix how the setuptools command parses excludes in config files

- Fix how the git hook determines which files to analyze (Thanks Chris
  Buccella!)
