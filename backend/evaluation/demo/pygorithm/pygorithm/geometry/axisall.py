segments. This class simplifies intermediary calculations in
SAT and similiar algorithms.

    Define an axis aligned line.

    This class provides functions related to axis aligned lines as well as
    acting as a convienent container for them. In this context, an axis
    aligned line is a two-dimensional line that is defined by an axis and
    length on that axis, rather than two points. When working with two lines
    defined as such that have the same axis, many calculations are
    simplified.

    .. note::

        Though it requires the same amount of memory as a simple representation of
        a 2 dimensional line (4 numerics), it cannot describe all types of lines.
        All lines that can be defined this way intersect (0, 0).

    .. note::

        `min` and `max` are referring to nearness to negative and positive infinity,
        respectively. The absolute value of `min` may be larger than that of `max`.

    .. note::

        AxisAlignedLines are an intermediary operation, so offsets should be baked
        into them.
