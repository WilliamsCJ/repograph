 Exploring Flake8's Internals
==============================

While writing |Flake8| 3.0, the developers attempted to capture some reasoning
and decision information in internal documentation meant for future developers
and maintainers. Most of this information is unnecessary for users and plugin
developers. Some of it, however, is linked to from the plugin development
documentation.

Keep in mind that not everything will be here and you may need to help pull
information out of the developers' heads and into these documents. Please
pull gently.
