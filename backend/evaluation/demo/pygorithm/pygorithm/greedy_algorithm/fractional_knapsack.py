    The knapsack problem or rucksack problem is a problem in combinatorial optimization: Given a set of
    items, each with a weight and a value, determine the number of each item to include in a collection so
    that the total weight is less than or equal to a given limit and the total value is as large as
    possible. It derives its name from the problem faced by someone who is constrained by a fixed-size
    knapsack and must fill it with the most valuable items.
