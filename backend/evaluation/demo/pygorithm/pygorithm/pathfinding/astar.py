A*

Author: Timothy Moore

A* is an informed search algorithm, or a best-first search,
meaning that it solves problems by searching among all possible
paths to the solution (goal) for the one that incurs the smallest
cost (least distance travelled, shortest time, etc.), and among
these paths it first considers the ones that appear to lead most
quickly to the solution.

    # Some miscellaneous notes:

    # River example neighbors
    # Imagine you had a graph that was constructed by the time it
    # would take to get to different strategic locations on a map.
    # Suppose there is a river that cuts the map in half vertically,
    # and two bridges that allow crossing at the top and bottom of
    # the map, but swimming is an option but very slow.
    # For simplicity, on each side there is 1 base that acts as a
    # strategic location, both sides of the each bridge, and both
    # sides of the river directly in the vertical center, for a total
    # graph of 8 nodes (see imgs/onedirectionalastar_riverexample.png)
    #
    # Now suppose the heuristic naively used euclidean distance while
    # the actual weights were based on precalculated paths.
    #
    # Looking at the picture, if you were going from one base to the other
    # middle side of the river, you would first expand the base and find
    # 3 nodes: top (15 + 10), your side of center (5 + 3), bottom (15 + 10).
    #
    # You would expand your side of center and find the top and bottom at
    # (5 + 12) - WORSE than just going to them. This is the case where we
    # would NOT add the path base->center->top to the _open list because
    # (for these weights) it will never be better than base->top.
    #
    # You would also add the new node (55 + 0) or the destination.
    #
    # Then you expand the top node (or bottom) on the other side of
    # river with a cost of (18 + 12).
    #
    # You expand the top node on the other side of the river next and find
    # one of the neighbors is already on the _open list (the destination)
    # at a score of (55 + 0), but your cost to get there is (30 + 0). This
    # is where you would REPLACE the old path with yourself.

        This implementation is one-directional expanding
        from the start to the end. This implementation is
        faster than dijkstra based on how much better the
        heuristic is than flooding.

        The heuristic must never overestimate the distance
        between two nodes (in other words, the heuristic
        must be "admissible"). Note however that, in practice,
        it is often acceptable to relax this requirement and
        get very slightly incorrect paths if:
            - The distance between nodes are small
            - There are too many nodes for an exhaustive search
              to ever be feasible.
            - The world is mostly _open (ie there are many paths
              from the start to the end that are acceptable)
            - Execution speed is more important than accuracy.
        The best way to do this is to make the heuristic slightly
        pessimistic (typically by multiplying by small value such
        as 1.1). This will have the algorithm favor finishing its
        path rather than finding a better one. This optimization
        needs to be tested based on the map.
